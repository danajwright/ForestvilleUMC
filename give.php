			<h1>Giving is a Part of Worship</h1>
			<p>We believe giving cheerfully and sacrificially is an act of worship that blesses the giver as much as the receiver (2 Corinthians 9:6-7). Among many reasons the scriptures give us for why we should give, one that should move your heart most directly is because it makes us more like Christ. Giving is absolutely essential to following Christ.
			When we give out of love for Christ, and with a generous heart, it causes many changes within us. Here are a few to think about:</p>
			<br>
			<ul class="groups">
				<li>Giving directs our attention to Christ and increases our intimacy with the God (Matthew 6:21)</li>
				<li>Giving strengthens our character and conforms us more to Christ's image as an unselfish giver</li>
				<li>Giving helps us realize the true ownership of ALL of our possessions (I Chronicles 29:11-12)</li>
				<li>It teaches us to trust and submit everything to God (Deuteronomy 14:22-23)</li>
				<li>It works as our greatest weapon against the idolatry of money and its illusion of power in our lives</li>
			</ul>
