## Forestville United Methodist Church
**A community church in Forestville, CA**

There aren't very many commits because I built most of the site before learning much about Github. This is a fully responsive site, built without any templates, frameworks or libraries (other than JQUERY). It is integrated with Perch, the really little cms so non-technical church ladies can update it and do some blogging no problem.

### Some hilights:

* All units 100% relative (ems, rems, %s)
* Fluid/ stretchy images using cover element
* Responsicve JQUERY toggle menu
* Application caching

**Once I turn it live, you will be able to view the site live [here.](http://forestvilleumc.org)**
